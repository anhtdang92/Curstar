# STAR Project Instructions
# This file contains instructions for the STAR project.

# Project Overview
# STAR is a video super-resolution project based on the NJU-PCALab/STAR repository.
# It uses diffusion models to enhance video quality.

# Setup Instructions
# 1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/anhtdang92/Curstar.git
# 2. Create a virtual environment: python -m venv venv
# 3. Activate the virtual environment:
#    - Windows: .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
#    - Linux/Mac: source venv/bin/activate
# 4. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Model Files Checklist
# Ensure the following files exist:
# - pretrained_models/cogvideox/vae/3d-vae.pt
# - pretrained_models/cogvideox/transformer/CogVideoX-5B-based/1/mp_rank_00_model_states.pt
# - pretrained_models/cogvideox/t5-v1_1-xxl/ (with all 8 required files)
# If missing, run download_models.py or download from https://huggingface.co/THUDM/CogVideoX-2b
#
# Note: After setup, you may see temp_* folders (e.g., temp_t5, temp_cogvideox, temp_cogvideo). These are not needed and can be safely deleted.

# Usage Instructions
# - Place input videos in the 'input/video/' directory.
# - Run the inference script: bash video_super_resolution/scripts/inference_sr.sh
# - Output videos will be saved in the specified output directory.

# Additional Notes
# - Ensure you have a GPU with at least 24GB of VRAM for optimal performance.
# - For more details, refer to the README.md file.
